            <summary>Guided tour</summary>
            Allows users to be on a guided tour, yet still be able to leave tour at an any spot, continue browsing along any other links they find interesting, 
            and return back to their breakaway point.

            <summary>Backtrack</summary>
            Most important navigation tool is the backtrack, 
            which takes user back to previous node.
            <br>
            <br>
            Almost all hypertext systems provide some backtrack, but not always consistently.
            It serves as a lifeline to get back to familiar territory.

            <summary>Bookmarks</summary>
            Setting bookmarks allow users to define bookmarks at nodes to return to later. 
            A special kind of bookmark would allow user to resume the session with a hypertext system after an interruption and keep state of hypertext unchanged.

            <summary>Navigation metaphors</summary>
            Navigation dimensions and metaphors can help users better understand 
            the structure of information spaces and their own movements.

            <summary>Queries</summary>
            Searching for information in hypertext can be performed purely by navigation, 
            but it should also be possible for the user to be able to find things through other search mechanisms (i.e. queries)

        <p>
            At its core, Xanadu is the dream of a global, permanent, interlinked library of everything ever written—a way to store, 
            share, and connect all human knowledge in a more powerful and coherent way than the World Wide Web eventually provided.
        </p>

        <b style="font-size:2em">True Hypertext</b>
        <br>
        <p>Unlike the web’s "one-way links," Xanadu envisioned two-way links—if document A linked to document B, B would know it, too. No "broken links."
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b style="font-size:2em">Granularity</b>
        <br>
        <p>Links could go to the smallest pieces of text, not just whole documents.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b style="font-size:2em">Archive Versioning</b>
        <br>
        <p>Every change to a document would be permanently recorded. Nothing would ever truly be lost or overwritten.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b style="font-size:2em">Universal Library</b>
        <br>
        <p>The vision was to have one system where all documents, media, and their connections were stored and accessible forever.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b style="font-size:1em">Issues</b>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size:.8em">There are social problems inherent in such shared spaces: 
            <br>
            (1) “Perverted” links - the graffiti on the web
            <br>
            (2) Problem of nonsequentiality - large parts of our culture is based on the assumption of people reading things in linear order 
            <br>
            (3) Give a fragmented view of the world
            <br>
            (4) Nelson's Project Xanadu never became the standard; Instead, Tim Berners-Lee’s simpler World Wide Web (released in 1991) took off because it was lightweight, open, and pragmatic.
